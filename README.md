## Introduction
In this repository, I solve different recursion problems using Java. The exercises range from basic to more advanced recursion topics.

## Exercises
- `00.factorial.java` - Implementation of factorial using recursion.
- `00.RecursiveMult.java` - Implementation of multiplication using recursion.
- More exercises will be added here as I progress.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Java files in your favorite IDE.
3. Run the Java files to see the recursion in action!
